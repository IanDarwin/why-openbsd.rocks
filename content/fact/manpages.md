title: "manpages"
---

There is probably no Operating System that is documented more and better than
OpenBSD. *Every single* binary, library, driver or script delivered in the
base system has its own manpage.

```
man cat         # of course, base system binary
man vio         # the virtual network driver
man null        # the /dev/null device
man daily       # the cronjobs that maintain your system
man adventure   # a game delivered in the base system
man hostname.if # network config documentation
```
