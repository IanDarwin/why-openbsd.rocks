title: "Reliable release model"
---

OpenBSD has a reliable release model. Every 6 months a new release of the
operating system will be released with new features and stability additions.
Only the two most recent OpenBSD releases receive security and reliability
fixes for the base system.

The version scheme is defined 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1.

Security fixes will be published as Errata and can be applied using
[syspatch](/fact/syspatch/)
