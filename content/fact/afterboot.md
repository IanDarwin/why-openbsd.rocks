title: afterboot(8)
---

After the first complete boot succeeded to the installation, OpenBSD purposes
 a complete document to list items for the system administrator to check and
 set up. The idea is to create a list of items that can be checked off so that you do
 not forget anything important.

This document first appeared in OpenBSD 2.2.
