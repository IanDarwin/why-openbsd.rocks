OpenBSD has *sane and secure defaults* set in daemons and configurations.

> The system is intended to be secure by default, and many of its security
> features are either missing or optional in other operating systems.

This means you don't have to tweak your freshly installed operating system to
get services running. There is no hardening process required when you setup
`sshd(8)`, for example. Just as for every other daemon or component in the
[base](/fact/base-system-concept/) system.
