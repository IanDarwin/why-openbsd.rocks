title: securelevel(7)
---

securelevel is a security mechanism in OpenBSD kernel. The OpenBSD kernel
 provides four levels of system security, from insecure mode to draconian mode.
 This ultimate mode is a last line of defence if the superuser account is
 compromised or limit potential damage.

The securelevel manual page first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6.
