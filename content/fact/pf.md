`pf` is OpenBSD's very own firewall, since 3.0. It is simple and feature-rich
and its configuration files are easy to read.  It supports the use of variables,
lists and tables.

```
tcpin = "{ http, https, ssh }"

block in all
pass out quick on $extif from any to any
pass in on $extif proto tcp from any to any port $tcpin
```
