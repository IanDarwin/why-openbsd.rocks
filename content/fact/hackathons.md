title: "Hackathons"
---

June 1999 was the first time that a group of OpenBSD developers met in one
space to begin working on cryptographic code. Hackathons for OpenBSD now take
place three to four times a year and cover a variety of improvements to the
codebase.  

Hackathons are open to developers, or by invite only, and are held
all over the world.

Funding for hackathons is made possible by donations from people like you. Consider donating to the
OpenBSD Foundation to continue funding for these events.
