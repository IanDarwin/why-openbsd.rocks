title: "syspatch(8)"
---

It is a common mistake to manually patch and recompile OpenBSD when security
updates are required.  Since 6.1, OpenBSD has supported binary patches using
its own `syspatch(8)` tooling! Binary updates are available for the current and
previous versions of amd64, i386 and arm64.

Consider subscribing to the announce mailing list to be informed of security
updates.
